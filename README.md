  - There might some errors in the documentation readme.txt files
  - You can try out the spells by opening the spell tab (key t by default) and assign two active spells with keys 1 and 2
  - The menus should use the user assigned keys aswell.(Annoying to switch between hardcoded and user defined keys)
  - I left small part of the game out, which was before starting campaign it would allow the player to create a name for the character.
  Since its disabled, it assigns the player with the name 'default'.

# This is the bundled version of the game

# There's an earlier versio of the game on video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYTkgtXdAsk

Someone asked about the Day/Night cycle code, so i made small easy example. (Doesn't have the Thunder/Rain but can be extended easily)
See the daynightcycle.py (Download the test texture aswell or provide your own test texture(s))

The entire Source code will be released, when everything has been commented and a bit more modernized.

Oh and every menu works with the arrows and enter/right shift

while the game allows to modify these keypress settings. It only affects the in-game playing, not menues.
