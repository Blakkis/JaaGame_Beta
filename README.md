Someone asked about the Day/Night cycle code, so i made small easy example. (Doesn't have the Thunder/Rain but can be extended easily)
See the daynightcycle.py (Download the test texture aswell or provide your own test texture(s))

The entire Source code will be released, when everything has been commented and a bit more modernized.

Oh and every menu works with the arrows and enter/right shift

while the game allows to modify these keypress settings. It only affects the in-game playing, not menues.
